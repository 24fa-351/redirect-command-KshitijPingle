## How to Use
Run r.sh file to compile program

./redirect output_file commands arguments

Use a __'-'__ as the first argument if you don't want to provide an output file  
Similarly, use a __'-'__ as the third argument if you don't want to provide any other arguments

#### Example
./redirect - "ls -l" -  
./redirect output.txt "ls -l" -
